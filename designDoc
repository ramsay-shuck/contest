Contest Plan:

-Note- The only default way to keep track of moves is the scared timer. Having our own tracker as part of the 
Offensive and DefensiveAgents might be helpful in determining when to recalculate paths and proximity to enemies.

-Game Start!
-Initialize!
--Particle filter construction!
--Build the initial most efficient path! 
  The Spawn point is effectively in the same spot on every different map,
  so this can even be a path to just the closest enemy food until we recalculate the path. Can Recalculate the path when 
  our pacmans see the first fork in the road after spawning to save computing time.
--Start Moving!
---Keep track of how many moves occurred.
---Travel along the calculateed path
---This path includes:
----depth limited to conserve computation time.
----enemy food locations
----enemy locations
----enemy capsule locations. 
    Measure these proximities against enemy proximity along the path. Can decrease the weight of the capsule if it is early
    in the game (save capsules for a rainy day near the end) and increase their weight near the end of the game 
    (don't let them go to waste). Otherwise, the capsule proximities and enemy proximities should be on par with 
    each other disregarding the previously mentioned weight.
----A Star Search. 
    Need to be quick.
